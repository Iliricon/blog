Hi, my name is Claas. I am a computer science student, connoisseur of failed cooking experiments and human being. In the past I have been accused of having a very stern resting face, of being political to a fault and of being way to exited in the morning. As for my virtues, people frequently list: not failing at cooking experiments as often as I fear, not being a complete bore and having a pretty decent singing voice.

The story of my life began some years ago in the little town of Bad Soden, Taunus. Even though I got around quite a lot, I haven't really moved far from my origins in total. I'm currently studying, sleeping and sometimes even having fun in Darmstadt, more specifically at the _Technische Universit√§t Darmstadt_. But getting here was a pretty long trip. My father worked for a couple of years in NYC and my family tagged along. After I got my my high school diploma, I decided to see some more of the world on my own and spend half a year in the cozy little town of Bani, Pangasinan, Philippines. I even now some Tagalog, but sadly my skills haven't progressed far beyond "_Kumusta ka?_" (How are you?) and "_Busok na ako!!!_" (Please don't feed me anymore, I am nearly bursting).

To take a break from seeing the world, I figured I could do something useful with my life and turn my passion for math into shiny gold and silver. As of now the gold and silver has failed to turn up, but I learned a couple of fun things along the way (like writing long meandering introductions at 1:00 AM). Currently, I style myself _data scienctist_ because it sounds more fancy then _person who is able to import the tensorflow library_.

OK, I will admit it. There is a striking pattern: Queer people write "human being" in their introduction. You caught me.
