To be honest, this is by far not my first run in the [bloggosphere](https://xkcd.com/1043/). I've had several blogs before, some public, others a more private affair. To gather some of my old content and make it accesible under my own name again, I started to migrate some old blogposts into this new site and tag them with ['archive'](/tags/archive/). Enjoy!
