> I see numbers crawling by,
> Crawling slowly up the screen,
> I don't know, I want to cry,
> Knowing where I could have been.
>
> Please, my code, run faster yet,
> Begs my heart so bored to tears.
> Knowing that the files I get,

> Error, sorry, start again,
> Prints the screen with some remorse,
> Thinking it can break my zen,
> It is right, I cry, of course!
