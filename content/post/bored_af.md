> I see numbers crawling by,</br>
> Crawling slowly up the screen,</br>
> I don't know, I want to cry,</br>
> Knowing where I could have been.</br>

> Please, my code, run faster yet,</br>
> Begs my heart so bored to tears.</br>
> Knowing that the files I get,</br>
> will be waiting some more years.</br>

> Error, sorry, start again,</br>
> Prints the screen with some remorse,</br>
> Thinking it can break my zen,</br>
> It is right, I cry, of course!</br>
